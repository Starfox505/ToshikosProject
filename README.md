# ToshikosProject
 This is my final project for my HTML/CSS class. I will be making a website based around the restaurant I work for called Toshikos. It has been open for nearly 13 years, and serves Japanese Cuisine food such as Sushi, Teriyaki Bowls, Ramen, and Appetizers like Gyoza, Edamame, and Calamari. It contains a home page, a reservation page to reserve a table, an order menu with sections and pages for each section of food we serve, along with a contact page.
